# Business Suite

## ðŸ’¡ The Concept

Business Suite is a demonstration Spring Boot application that exposes a modular API for common business operations.  It currently focuses on stock management but is designed so additional modulesâ€”such as employee time tracking, sales and invoice managementâ€”can be plugged in over time.  The project highlights typical patterns for building secured REST services with Swagger documentation, validation and unit tests.

### Features
* Inventory and client management
* Supplier tracking
* Preference-based alerts
* Basic authentication setup
* Example unit tests with Mockito

This public demo omits sensitive code that exists in the private version.  Planned modules include:

* Worker clock in/out tracking
* Sales and purchase processing
* Invoicing and payment flows
* Notification and email automations

### Getting Started
1. Ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed.
2. Configure the database connection in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
3. Build and run using `mvn spring-boot:run` or generate the wrapper with `mvn -N wrapper:wrapper`.
4. Execute the unit tests with `mvn test`.

The provided data and configurations are for demonstration only.  Review and adapt them before using the code in production.
